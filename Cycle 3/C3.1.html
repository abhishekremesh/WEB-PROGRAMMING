<h2><u>HTML</u></h2>
<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet.</p>
<p>The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.</p>
<p>Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag.</p>
